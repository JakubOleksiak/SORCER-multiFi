	Method				Line of code			Description
1.	CoffeeMaker.addRecipe()		CoffeeMaker#25			More than 3 recipes could be added to the recipe list. The NUM_RECIPES was set to 4, fixed it by changing it to 3.
2.	CoffeeMaker.deleteRecipe()	CoffeeMaker#92			The method returned true (so indicated a successful deletion), but the recipe was not removed from the list. Inside the method the deletion was not occurring, rather it just reassigned the object to itself - fixed it by changing it to new Recipe() assignment and assigning false to the corresponding index in the recipeFull array.
3.	CoffeeMaker.editRecipe()	CoffeeMaker#126			Method returned false when it shouldn't. The method was comparing the names within the array with the new recipe name, not the old one, thus making no edits (or removing the existing recipe that was named the same as the newly edited one, in such a case the method returned true, but shouldn't). Fixed by changing the comparison from newRecipe to oldRecipe.
4.	CoffeeMaker.addInventory()	CoffeeMaker#150			The sugar could not be added as a positive value, but could be added as a negative value (so subtracted). Fixed by changing the sign in the if statement between amtSugar and 0 from > to <.
5.	CoffeeMaker.makeCoffee()	CoffeeMaker#186			The method actually added the coffee needed for the recipe to the inventory, not subtracted from it. Fixed by changing the + to -.
